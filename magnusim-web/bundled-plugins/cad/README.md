# Magnusim CAD 0.2.0-dev: the CAD plugin's development version

A parametric part modeler in the style of SolidWorks and Fusion, built into
Magnusim as the **Part** workspace. You draw sketches, turn them into solids,
edit STEP files, wrap the part in an air volume for CFD, and go back to the
simulation with the part already in the project.

It is a bundled plugin and it is on by default. Settings > Plugins turns it off
(Disable); while it is off, nothing of it runs. Everything runs in the app's
window: the modeling kernel (Open CASCADE 7.9.3) and the sketch solver
(FreeCAD's PlaneGCS) run as WebAssembly in the workspace's own workers, so CAD
needs no Python, no WSL and no internet connection.

What is new in each version: `CHANGELOG.md`. How it is built: the
[Developer](#developer) section below.

## Start a part

A Part lives in a project, like a simulation study. Start one from any of these:

- **Design a part**, beside "Add geometry", on a project with no geometry yet.
- **New project** on Home, then **Start from: Design a part**: the title fills in
  ("Untitled Part N"), and Create makes the project and opens a Part in one step.
- The **CAD** button in the project header: its menu lists the project's Parts
  and makes a new one.
- Once a project has a Part, the tree's STUDIES section lists it, with
  **+ New Part**.

The Part opens in its own full-page workspace over the project. It uses the
project's units (millimetres, inches and so on); a typed value may carry its own
unit ("125 mm", "5 in").

## The workspace

- **Toolbar** across the top. In model mode its groups are SKETCH, SOLID,
  PATTERN, MODIFY, CONSTRUCT, CFD PREP, INSPECT and FILE, then the views and
  Undo / Redo. It starts compact: each group shows its main one or two commands
  (Sketch; Extrude; Linear pattern; Fillet and Chamfer; Plane; Enclosure;
  Measure; Import STEP), and the rest of the group is in its **More ▾** menu. In
  sketch mode the ribbon shows DRAW, CONSTRAIN, DIMENSION and MODIFY.
  - Arrange it your way: right-click a command for **Show in toolbar**, **Move to
    More**, **Move left**, **Move right** and **Reset toolbar**, or drag a command
    along its group. Drag a command out of a group's **More** onto the toolbar: it
    goes in where you drop it and the group's last command moves to More (the
    toolbar says which while you drag), so the group keeps its size; right-click
    it in More for **Swap with** that last command. Drag a command into its
    group's open More to put it there. A command stays in its own group. The
    layout is yours in every project, and another open CAD tab follows a change
    at once.
  - A command that cannot run right now is greyed, and its tooltip says why
    ("Make or import a body first").
- **Design tree** on the left: **Origin** (the Top, Front and Right planes and
  the X, Y and Z axes), **Bodies**, and **History**, the features in build order
  with a rollback bar. The chevron at its top right (or `Ctrl+\`) slides it into a
  slim rail at the left edge; click the rail to bring it back. It stays the way
  you leave it, in every project. While you edit a sketch it is a rail by itself
  (click the rail to see it for that sketch) and comes back at **Done**.
- **Feature panels** open on the left when you make or edit a feature. Changes
  apply live as you type or pick; **Done** closes the panel; **Delete** removes
  the feature (on a new one it discards it).
- **Viewport** with the view triad, the views menu (the standard views, Normal
  to, Perspective or Orthographic, Shaded, Shaded + edges, Wireframe), the
  **Selection filter** (Bodies, Faces, Edges, Vertices, Planes) and the
  **Section view** button (the same cut as INSPECT > Section view).
- **Chips** at the bottom: the selected body's volume (or each body's, never a
  total), the number of items selected, the save state and the sketch's state.
- **Banana for scale** (SCALE MODELS, after VIEW) puts a yellow banana beside the
  bodies to show their size. Drag it: it moves parallel to the screen, stays
  within reach of the part and snaps to the spots beside it (hold Alt not to
  snap); right-click it for Place next to part, Turn 90° and Remove banana.
  Click the button again to remove it. It is not a body and never reaches the simulation. In a sketch the same
  button tapes a true-size banana picture to the sketch's plane, behind the
  sketch; move it with the Select tool (drawing tools draw over it), right-click
  it for Place next to sketch.

## Sketches

Click **Sketch** (or right-click a flat face: **New sketch on this face**), then
pick an origin plane, a CONSTRUCT plane or a flat face of a body. The view turns
square to the sketch. **Finish sketch** (or Enter with no tool step open) leaves
sketch mode; the camera stays where it is.

The **Sketch panel** is compact: the sketch's name and state, what the tool
wants next and its own fields, the dimension you are editing, and **Done**.
Problems always show there (a failed sketch, the constraints that over-define
it, a lost reference). **Details ▸** in its foot adds the plane, the selection
with Construction and Delete selected, every pattern and the references; it
stays open or closed the way you leave it. The chevron in the panel's head (or
`Ctrl+\`) slides the panel into a slim rail at the left edge, with the sketch's
state dot and **Finish sketch** on it; the next sketch opens the same way. While
it is a rail, a tool that has its own fields (Offset's distance, Fillet's
radius, a pattern's count) shows them in a small card beside the rail.

**Draw** (DRAW group):

- **Line** (L): chained lines, click by click. A, or a drag from the end, makes
  a tangent arc. Click and drag draws one line from the press to the release
  (Rectangle, Circle, 3-point arc and Tangent arc draw the same way).
- **Rectangle** (R, two corners) and **Center rectangle**.
- **Circle** (C), **3-point arc** (A), **Tangent arc**, **Point**,
  **Centerline**.
- **Spline** (S): a fit-point spline through the points you click. Double-click
  or Enter places it; a click on its first point closes it. Its fit points are
  ordinary sketch points: dimension them, relate them, drag them.
- **Control-point spline**: degree 3 (or 5), pulled by its control points;
  the control polygon shows dashed while it is selected.
- **Construction** (X, in DRAW's More): with a drawing tool in hand, or nothing
  selected, it turns construction drawing on or off. While it is on (checked in
  More, pressed if you put it on the toolbar, and the view says "Construction
  (X)"), every line, rectangle, circle, arc and spline you draw is construction.
  It is off again when the sketch closes. With curves selected and no drawing
  tool, it turns them into construction geometry and back; right-click a
  selection for the same **Construction** (a mixed selection offers **Make
  construction** and **Make normal**).

While you draw, a value box follows the pointer: type a length or an angle and
press Enter or Tab. A click counts where you pressed, even when the mouse is
still moving as you click. The pointer is a thin crosshair with the tool's icon
beside it. With no tool in hand it is a small arrow with a tiny icon of what is
under it (a point, a line, an arc, a circle or an ellipse), and a four-way arrow
while you drag. The point under the pointer grows in a light blue disk; a
selected point is green with a green ring.

Relations (the small horizontal, parallel, tangent, ... badges) show only for
the geometry you select. **Show relations** (VIEW, Shift+R) shows them all and
is remembered; a relation in conflict always shows, in red. Dimensions always
show. The pointer snaps to the sketch (ends, midpoints,
centres, curves, horizontal and vertical) and to the model itself: a body's
vertex, an edge's middle, a point on an edge, a round edge's centre (hover the
rim first), and the point where an edge pierces the sketch plane. Clicking a model snap adds
a linked reference and the relation in one undo step. Hold Ctrl to draw without
snapping.

**Modify** (MODIFY group):

- **Trim** (T) and **Extend**: click the piece to cut off, or the end to extend
  to the next curve. Splines can be trimmed and trimmed against.
- **Offset** (O): point at a curve; its chain (lines, arcs and splines joined end
  to end) is previewed on the pointer's side. Click to place; **Both sides** is
  an option. Line and arc offsets stay tied to their source.
- **Fillet** and **Chamfer** of a sketch corner, with a Radius or Distance
  dimension you can edit later. A new fillet shows an arrow on its arc: drag it
  and the arc's middle follows the pointer (inward, away from the corner, for a
  bigger radius; towards the corner for a smaller one) (the Radius box follows;
  it stops at the largest radius the corner takes and says why). Select a fillet
  arc later to get the arrow back.
- **Mirror** (M): pick entities, then the mirror line. The copies stay
  symmetric to their source.
- **Linear pattern** (one or two directions; count, spacing, angle or "Along a
  line") and **Circular pattern** (about the origin or a picked centre; full
  circle or a total angle). The copies are tied to their source and follow it.
  The pattern you just made or selected has a row in the Sketch panel (every
  pattern has one under **Details**) where you change its count,
  spacing or angle, bring back a deleted copy, or **Dissolve** it (the copies
  become free geometry where they are). Deleting a pattern's source makes the
  next copy the source; the message offers **Dissolve pattern** instead.
- **Project** (P): click a body's vertex, edge or face to bring it into the
  sketch, or switch on **Silhouette** and click a body for its outline seen
  along the sketch normal. Works on imported STEP bodies too.
- **Intersect**: the curves where the sketch plane cuts the bodies (all shown
  bodies, or the ones you click).
- **Import SVG/DXF**: pick an SVG or an ASCII DXF file (at most 20 MB). The
  Sketch panel shows what it read (lines, arcs, circles, ellipses, splines and
  points), what it skipped and why (text, scripts, pictures, links to other
  files, DXF dimensions and hatches...), its size in mm and its open ends; the
  curves preview in the sketch. **Scale** is mm per drawing unit, from the
  file's units (an SVG's width over its viewBox, else 96 px per inch; a DXF's
  $INSUNITS, or mm when it has none). **Place**: the drawing's own origin on the
  sketch origin, or centred there. A DXF's **layers** can be ticked off (one the
  file has off starts unticked). **OK** adds the curves as one undo step. Ends
  that meet share one point (the panel says within what distance), so closed
  outlines are profiles; no relations are added (fix or dimension what must
  hold). A drawing too heavy for the sketch solver (about 10,000 points, or 400
  arcs: every later change solves all of it) is refused with what it weighs. An SVG's curves are exact: cubic
  Beziers are splines, arcs are arcs, transforms are applied; a DXF's splines
  are exact too, except rational ones (made as fit splines through points of
  them; the panel says so). A drawing is read as data only: nothing in it runs
  or loads. Inside a sketch only (start the sketch first).
- **Copy and Paste** (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, or the right-click menu): select sketch
  geometry and copy it; Paste picks the copy up, held by the middle of its box,
  and it follows the pointer (snapping as the drawing tools do); click (or
  Enter) to place it, one undo step, Esc to put it down. Construction stays
  construction; the relations and dimensions between the copied pieces come
  with it, so the copy is as defined as the original; those that also tie
  geometry you did not copy are left out, and the panel says how many. A
  dimension keeps its expression where it gives the same value there, else the
  value it had (the panel says which). It pastes into any sketch, on any plane
  (the same 2D shape), also in another Part. In a text or number field the keys
  copy and paste text; with text selected (the panel's red note) Ctrl+C copies
  that text.

Projected and intersected curves are **linked**: drawn purple, fixed in place,
and recomputed whenever the model rebuilds, so a sketch built on them follows
the model. Dimensions, relations, Trim (against them) and regions all use them.
**Break link** (right-click, or its References row under the panel's
**Details**) turns one into
ordinary geometry. If its source disappears upstream, the curve turns amber,
the panel says "Lost reference: ...", and the sketch still solves; nothing is
blocked.

**Select** in a sketch: click, Ctrl+click to toggle, or **Ctrl + drag a box**.
Dragging left to right selects what the box encloses (solid box); right to left,
what it touches (dashed box). Ctrl+Shift + drag adds to the selection. In sketch
mode the Selection filter offers Points, Curves and Dimensions.

## Constraints and dimensions

**Relations** (CONSTRAIN group): Coincident, Horizontal, Vertical, Parallel,
Perpendicular, Tangent, Equal, Midpoint, Symmetric, Concentric, Collinear and
Fix. Select the items first, then click the relation; if the selection does not
fit, the button says what it needs. Many relations are added for you while you
draw (inferred).

**Dimensions** (D): pick one or two items and place the label. Lengths,
distances, radii, diameters and angles. Every label shows its unit ("⌀125 mm",
"R10 mm", "40 mm", "30°"). Double-click a label to change it; type a number,
a value with a unit, or an expression using your named parameters ("fx: 40 mm"
marks a value from an expression). A dimension that would over-define the
sketch can be placed as a **driven** (reference) dimension, shown in brackets:
"(40 mm)".

**How defined the sketch is**: the sketch chip says "Under defined · 2 DOF",
"Fully defined", or which relations conflict. Free geometry is drawn in blue and
fully defined geometry in black; an over-defined sketch shows red. Drag
under-defined geometry to move it; a fully defined entity keeps the normal arrow
and the panel says why it cannot move ("This line is fully defined: change a
dimension to move it").

## Solids

Solids come only from sketches and from STEP files: there is no one-click box
or cylinder. Every body-making feature has an **Operation**: New body, Join,
Cut or Intersect, with the bodies it works on.

**Join merges bodies that only touch** (face to face, with no overlap) into one
body, as well as bodies that overlap. This is by design (decided for 0.1.0): two
blocks placed side by side and joined become one solid. Use New body to keep
touching bodies apart.

- **Extrude** (E): pick sketch regions (profiles). Extents: blind, two sides,
  symmetric, through all, or up to a face or a vertex, with an offset; along the
  sketch normal or a chosen direction; Flip; a **Draft angle** (walls that lean,
  narrowing the profile as it goes). You can also extrude a **flat face
  of a body** directly, with no sketch: right-click it, **Extrude face**. A drag
  arrow in the view changes the distance.
- **Revolve**: profiles about an axis (a centerline or line of the sketch, a
  straight or round edge, a round face's axis, an origin or CONSTRUCT axis); one
  side, symmetric or two sides, by an angle.
- **Sweep**: a profile along a sketched path; **Follow path** or **Keep
  orientation**.
- **Loft**: through two or more profiles, in the order you pick them (Move up /
  Move down); **Ruled** for straight sides.
- **Hole** (a flat face's menu, or SOLID > Hole): round holes into one flat face
  facing along X, Y or Z. Click the face for each centre, type them, or take
  them **From a sketch** (a hole at each of its points and circle centres, and
  they follow those points when that sketch changes). **Size**, metric or inch:
  a custom diameter, a **clearance hole for a bolt** (M1.6 to M64, ISO 273; #0 to
  1 in, ASME B18.2.8; close, normal or loose fit) or a **tapped hole** (ISO coarse
  or UNC / UNF: its tap drill, and its thread, listed and drawn in the view as a
  coil with its size, "M6x1"; **Thread: Modelled** also cuts the real thread into
  the wall, as the feature "Hole 1 thread", which follows the hole).
  **Type**: simple, **counterbore** (diameter, depth) or **countersink**
  (diameter at the face, angle); with a clearance hole, **From the screw table**
  sizes them for a socket head cap screw (ISO 4762, DIN 974-1; M3 to M30) or a
  countersunk head screw (ISO 10642, 90°; M3 to M20). Through, or blind with a
  flat bottom or a **drill point**. It makes ordinary sketches and cut extrudes
  ("Hole 1 sketch", "Hole 1", and "Hole 1 counterbore" or "Hole 1 tip"), one
  undo step, that follow your parameters. A blind hole deeper than the body says
  that it goes through; counterbores that would overlap are refused. A tapped
  hole's Extrude panel shows its **Thread**, with **Remove**.

## Modify: fillets, shells, booleans and direct edits

- **Fillet**: round edges with a radius. Tangent edges are taken as a chain. A
  radius that is too large names the edges and says which radius works.
- **Chamfer**: one distance, or two (Flip sides swaps them). A distance that is
  too large says what works.
- **Shell**: hollow a body to a wall thickness, removing the faces you pick;
  inside or outside.
- **Combine**: Join, Cut or Intersect several target bodies with several tool
  bodies; **Keep the tool bodies** is an option.
- **Split**: cut a body in two by a plane, a flat face or another body.
- **Move/copy body** (M, or "Move/copy Body 1…" in a body's menu): move bodies
  by X, Y, Z and turn them by an angle about X, Y or Z through a pivot (the
  centre of their box unless you type one) or about an axis, a straight or round
  edge, a round face or a sketch line. It turns first, then moves. A moved body
  keeps its name and faces, so later features still find them, and what you made
  on it (a hole sketched on its face, a fillet) goes with it when you change the
  move or put one in before it. While you edit it, the features after it are
  rolled back, as for a sketch. **Keep a copy**
  leaves the bodies and moves copies ("Body 1 (Copy)"). Or drag the handle in
  the view: its arrows move along X, Y, Z, its rings turn (Ctrl: whole mm and
  15°); the fields follow, and Escape during a drag puts it back.
- **Delete faces and heal**: remove faces (a hole, a fillet, a boss) and let
  the kernel close the gap. When that heal cannot do it cleanly (the fillets of
  a part with a cavity on each side, such as a rounded T-block) and the faces
  are every fillet of the body up to the largest picked radius, they are taken
  off as fillets (Analysis Situs) and the row says so. A red Delete faces names
  the faces that would make the pick whole, and **Add the rest** in its panel
  adds them; when the fillets up to that radius include rings round a boss or a
  hole, which cannot come off as fillets, it says so instead. On a body over
  a face limit (holes are found on bodies of up to 2,600 faces, fillets up to
  5,000) the red words say what was not looked for and name both limits.
  Rounds that end on other fillets' corner pieces (a T-block rounded R2 and
  then R1 along it) come off one round at a time with those corner pieces, and
  the row says so. The heal has 20 s (120 s on a part of over 2,000 faces), the
  time it had before; one that does not finish is red in words, the body
  unchanged. In the panel, **Fillets up to** [R] **Add** and **Holes up to Ø**
  [D] **Add** pick the faces by size (whole drilled holes, through holes too)
  and say what they added; with no face picked yet they use the Part's one solid
  body. A Ctrl+drag box in the view adds the faces it selects while the panel is
  open.
- **Press-pull** (Q): move faces along their normal. Out adds material, in
  removes it. Flat and curved faces, several at once:
  - a sloping neighbour is extended to meet the moved face, so no step is left;
  - a hole's bore or a boss changes its radius, and the panel says so ("Bore
    radius 10 mm → 8 mm"; 2 mm out on a 10 mm bore makes it 8 mm);
  - a fillet face changes its radius and stays tangent;
  - fillets and chamfers beside a moved face keep their size;
  - a move that would close a hole, cut the part through itself or leave a step
    is refused in red with a distance that works ("the hole would close: 9.9 mm
    or less works").

Every result is checked (still a valid solid, no face lost, a plausible volume
change) before it is taken. When a feature fails, it turns red with the reason
in plain words, and the model before it still shows.

## Patterns and mirror

The PATTERN group, beside SOLID:

- **Linear pattern**: one or two directions (an edge, an axis, a sketch line, or
  a plane's or flat face's normal), count with spacing or total extent,
  symmetric.
- **Circular pattern**: about an origin or CONSTRUCT axis, a straight edge or a
  round face; full 360° with equal spacing, or a set angle; symmetric.
- **Mirror**: across an origin or CONSTRUCT plane, or a flat face.

Each one repeats **features** (applied with each feature's own operation, or New
body / Join / Cut / Intersect), **bodies** (copies, named "Body 1 (Instance 2)")
or **faces** of one body (the boss or pocket they bound). Select what to repeat
before you click the command, or pick it in the panel. Numbered markers in the
view show each copy: click one to skip that copy, and use **Make it again** in
the panel to bring it back. Patterns of mirrors and mirrors of patterns work.
Copies keep stable names, so a fillet on copy 3 survives a change of count.

## Reference geometry

The CONSTRUCT group adds history features you can sketch on, extrude along,
revolve about, pattern about or mirror across. They follow the model when it
changes.

- **Plane**: offset, at an angle, through 3 points, midplane, normal to a curve
  at a point.
- **Axis**: through two points, of a round face, along an edge, where two planes
  cross.
- **Point**: at a vertex, at the centre of an arc, circle or sphere, on an edge
  at a distance or a percentage, where an edge crosses a plane, or at
  coordinates.

The origin's X, Y and Z axes are rows under Origin and can be used the same way.

## STEP files: import, edit, export

- **Import STEP** (FILE group): the file is read, healed (faces knitted into
  solids within a tolerance you can change) and added as an **Imported** feature,
  keeping the bodies' names and colours. A large file shows its progress and can
  be cancelled; a 113 MB, 11,776-face part imports in under a minute.
- Edit it with the same tools as a native part: Press-pull, Delete faces,
  Split, Combine, Fillet, Chamfer, Shell, sketches on its faces, Project of its
  edges. Each edit is a feature on top of the import, so it can be changed or
  undone later.
- **Export STEP**: the bodies you pick, as STEP AP214 or AP242, in the length
  unit you choose.

### Edit in CAD: a geometry imported in the simulation view

A STEP, IGES or BREP part you imported into the project (the simulation view)
opens in CAD from **Edit in CAD**: right-click its row (or one of its bodies) in
the tree, right-click the part in the viewport, or use the button in its Geometry
panel.

- The first time, a Part named like the geometry is made and imports it by
  itself: the import panel shows the progress and closes when it is done. If
  Magnusim is still updating the geometry, the Part says "Waiting for Magnusim to
  finish storing <geometry>" and goes on when it can (at most 2 minutes; **Stop**
  ends the wait, **Try again** starts it again); modelling waits meanwhile. A face
  you right-clicked in the viewport is selected.
- Open in two tabs at once, the part is imported once: the tab whose save came
  second shows Reload, and after it uses the same import.
- Edit it as any import. **Back** with a change updates the geometry; when a
  simulation uses it, Back asks first, as for any Part: **Overwrite
  <geometry>** updates the geometry in place (the same geometry, its boundary
  conditions, refinements and monitors carried over by face), **Save as new
  geometry** adds a new one, **Keep editing** stays. Meshes are marked out of
  date; nothing is deleted. The original file is kept, and the Geometry panel can
  add it back as a geometry of its own.
- **Back with no change changes nothing** in the project, also after an Undo
  back to the import.
- **Edit in CAD again** opens the same Part with its history; it does not import
  again.
- If the geometry is **removed** from the project, the Part says so (one line).
  Back with a change then asks first: **Add as new geometry** adds the part as a
  geometry of its own, **Not now** leaves the project as it is (and does not ask
  again until you change the part), **Keep editing** stays. A Part opened for a
  geometry that was removed before anything was imported imports nothing.
- The faces of the part in CAD are matched to the geometry's own (by number,
  then by place, size and facing), and Magnusim checks each match again. If some
  could not be matched or checked, the Part says how many, and if the matching
  failed, it says why: those boundary conditions follow by shape only (a face
  you move or resize then loses its boundary condition).
- A mesh geometry (STL, OBJ, PLY) shows Edit in CAD greyed out, with the reason:
  import the part as STEP to edit it.

## CFD prep: Enclosure and Combine

**Enclosure** (CFD PREP group) makes the box or cylinder of air around the part,
once the part has a body:

- **Box**, or **Cylinder** with its axis, around the exact bounding box of the
  bodies you choose (all of them by default).
- **Padding**: **Zero** (tight to the part, the default), **Percent** of the
  part's size, or **Fixed** distance. Each side then has its own value: type it,
  or drag that side's arrow in the view (Escape during a drag puts it back).
- A side may go into the part (an amber note names it: the fluid leaves out the
  part beyond it), but never past the part's far side.
- It follows the part when the part changes, keeping your padding. It is drawn
  see-through, so a click picks the part inside it. Its faces are named by side
  ("+X face of Enclosure 1", "Top face"), which become clear patch names in the
  simulation.

The air volume is always a separate step: **Combine**, **Cut**, with the
Enclosure as the target and the part as the tool (**Keep the tool bodies**
comes on). Rename the result, for example to "Fluid".

## Measure and inspect

- **Measure**: click faces, edges and vertices for distances, angles, lengths,
  radii and areas. Its picks survive a rebuild that keeps their geometry.
- **Mass properties**: volume, surface area, centroid and size, for each body
  and in total.
- **Find**: type what to find ("Body 1 faces >Z", "edges of Base.end") and see
  the matches lit, listed and counted; **Select all** selects them. Fillets and
  drilled holes are found by their shape, whatever made them: "Body 1 faces
  fillet <= 2 mm", "Body 1 faces hole <= 6 mm" (every face of the whole holes
  with that bore). Fillets are found on bodies of up to 5,000 faces, holes on
  bodies of up to 2,600; a larger body is refused in words that name both
  limits, and you select its faces in the view instead.
- **Check**: pick what to check at the top of the panel.
  - **Solids**: each body is "Valid", or its problems are listed by kind with
    where they are.
  - **Interference**: the pairs of bodies that overlap and how much (the
    selected bodies, or every shown one; one selected body against every other
    shown body). A bore drawn a little under its shaft is a press fit: listed
    apart, not as a collision. A clearance also lists the pairs closer than it.
  - **Loose parts**: the parts on each shaft in order, what holds each one,
    and which can slide along the shaft (which way and how far), with a play
    you set (0.5 mm if empty). The play is the gap between the bore and its
    shaft all round, so a D or hex shaft in a bore of its shape counts as
    loose, not pressed on. With bodies selected it checks the shafts near them.
  - **Rotation**: a body turned a full turn about an axis: the first angle it
    meets each other body, counter-clockwise about the axis's direction (the
    column says which way, e.g. "Counter-clockwise about +Z") and clockwise.

  Press Check to run one; Stop ends a long one. A check that runs past its
  time limit (90 s) says "Stopped at the time limit" and what helps: what it
  lists is only what it reached. Click a row to select its bodies. The
  Assistant runs the same checks and gets the same words.
- The **volume chip** shows the selected body's volume; with nothing selected it
  lists each body on its own. It never adds bodies together.
- **Section view** (INSPECT, key X) cuts the view on a plane, so you can see and
  reach faces inside the part. The panel opens with the view cut:
  - **Plane**: click a construction plane or a flat face in the view, or a plane
    in the tree, or Top, Front or Right. The cut is parallel to it, along its
    own normal (a construction plane at an angle cuts at that angle), and the
    panel names it. On a construction plane it starts at the plane itself; on
    an origin plane or a face, through the middle of the shown bodies.
  - **Offset**: how far from the plane along its normal (a length in the
    Part's units; parameters and expressions as in any length field); **Middle**
    cuts through the middle of the shown bodies. **Keep the other side** flips
    which half stays. **Cut the view** turns it off and on.
  - **The arrow** on the cut points along the plane's normal (the way Offset
    grows): drag it to move the cut, and Offset follows (hold Ctrl for whole
    millimetres, tenths of an inch in an inch Part). Esc while dragging puts it
    back.
  - The cut follows its plane: an edit that moves a construction plane, or a
    face that moves, moves the cut too. If the plane is deleted (or no longer
    builds), the section turns off and a note says why, and the next cut starts
    on Front; while a panel edits an earlier feature or the rollback bar is
    above the plane, the cut stays where it was (the note says it is rolled
    back). A Part opened with the bar above its section's plane opens uncut
    and keeps the section: it comes back once the plane builds.
  - The view tools' button and INSPECT > Section view turn the cut on where
    its plane is now (a face that moved while the cut was off is cut through
    its middle again).
  - It is a view, not a feature: no undo step, never in the model or the
    simulation. The Part keeps it, so it is there when you open the Part again.
    The view tools' section button and its quick controls (Top, Front, Right, a
    slider, Flip side, Middle) drive the same cut; **More** opens this panel.
  - The Assistant sets the same cut (workspace section, on any of these
    planes), reads it back (with the panel's note, and a face's selector it can
    use again), and draws pictures cut on any of them; the Picture panel's
    Section takes a construction plane or the selected flat face too.
- **See-through** (INSPECT) draws the selected bodies see-through (a selected
  face counts for its body), so you can see what is inside and behind them.
  Their edges stay drawn, and a click on them goes through to an opaque face
  behind (pick the see-through body itself in the tree, by an edge, or where
  nothing is behind it). Run it again while all of them are see-through to make
  them opaque; a mix of the two all turn see-through.
  - A body's menu (right-click its Bodies row, or the body in the view) has
    **Make Body 1 see-through** or **Make Body 1 opaque**, next to Hide. The row
    shows a see-through mark; a hidden body is dimmed instead, and a body can be
    both. An Enclosure's air is always see-through: its menu says so.
  - A section cuts a see-through body with a see-through cap, so a body inside
    it keeps its own cap and shows through.
  - It is a view, as hiding is: no undo step, never in the model or the
    simulation. The Part keeps it, so it is there when you open the Part again.
    Pictures draw see-through bodies see-through, as they leave out hidden ones.
  - It belongs to the body, as hiding does: a new body made from it (a split's
    other pieces, a Move/copy body copy, a pattern's copies) starts opaque,
    with its colour; make it see-through on its own.
  - The Assistant does the same (workspace see_through and opaque) and reads it
    back (get_model's parts say see_through).

## History, parameters, undo and saving

- **History**: right-click a feature for Edit, Rename, Suppress or Unsuppress,
  Roll back to here, Roll to end and Delete; a sketch or a reference plane,
  axis or point also has Hide or Show (its eye in the tree does the same; a
  hidden one is still used by what is built on it). Drag the rollback bar to
  see the part as it was at that feature. A feature that breaks because something
  upstream changed is marked red with the reason; a reference it can follow
  only approximately says "Reference repaired · check".
- **Parameters**: named values with units and expressions. Use them in any
  number field ("width * 2").
- **Undo and redo** (Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Y): up to 100 steps. One panel, one drag or one
  action is one step.
- **Saving is automatic.** The save chip says Saved, or what it is waiting for.
  If you leave while a change is still being written, the app asks first.
- **Two tabs**: if another tab saved the same Part while this tab has an
  unsaved change, you choose: **Reload (discard my change)** or **Keep mine
  (replace the other tab's save)**. Nothing is lost silently.

## Back to the simulation

A Part is **linked** to one geometry of its project. There is no export step:

- **Leave the Part** any way you like (Back, the browser's Back, another
  project, Home). The Part saves, the project's geometry is brought up to date,
  and you land in the simulation viewport looking at the part the way you left
  it. The first time, the geometry is created; after that it is updated in
  place.
- **Include in simulation**: each body has this toggle (its Bodies row and its
  menu). It is on for every solid body. A hidden body is still in the
  simulation while it is included.
- **Studies are kept**: boundary conditions and refinements follow faces by
  their CAD names. If a named face is gone, you are told which. Meshes are marked
  out of date; nothing is deleted.
- If nothing changed, leaving is instant. If a feature is broken, leaving asks
  first ("Couldn't update the project", with the reason). A broken reference
  plane, axis or point that nothing uses does not stop the update.

## The Assistant in the Part

*In development: this needs Magnusim's Assistant, which comes with Magnusim
0.5.0 and is not released yet.*

Magnusim's Assistant works with a model you choose in **Settings > Assistant**:
a cloud provider with your own key, or a local server on this PC. While a Part
is open in an app window on this PC, the Part offers the Assistant its own
tools, so you can ask it to build or change the part and watch it work. The
tools run in the Part like the rest of CAD; only the model runs elsewhere. A
page opened from another computer offers no tools.

**Asking.** Until the app's chat panel arrives, a request starts from the app's
terminal client, run in `magnusim-web` with the Part open and the Magnusim
window shown:

```
node scripts/assistant-run.mjs --tab auto "A 100 x 60 x 8 mm plate with four 6.5 mm through holes 10 mm from the edges, its sizes as parameters"
```

`--tab auto` sends the request to the one app tab that is connected. The
terminal shows each step and the answer, and the app shows its questions too.
One request at a time runs in a tab.

**What it can do.** Read the Part (features, sketches, parameters, bodies, and
what you changed since its last step), find faces, edges and sketch regions by
name or by a point on them, measure (volumes, voids, areas, distances, overlaps
of two bodies, sections), look at pictures of the Part, set parameters, sketch
(points, lines, centerlines, polylines, circles, arcs, rectangles, slots,
polygons and sectors, with relations and dimensions), extrude, revolve, sweep
and loft, drill holes into a flat face, fillet, chamfer and shell, pattern and
mirror, combine bodies, name and colour a body, change, rename, suppress or
move a feature, undo its own steps, and delete features. It makes the offset
planes its sketches and mirrors need. It does not export: use Export STEP, or
go Back to the simulation. It can also use the Part's other tools: Split,
Press-pull and Delete faces, the Enclosure, Import STEP (you pick the file),
CONSTRUCT's axes and points, an extrude of a face, and in a sketch Project /
Intersect, offsets, the linear and circular patterns, Copy and Paste (it copies
geometry from a sketch, or pastes what you copied with Ctrl+C) and Import
SVG/DXF (a drawing you attach in the Assistant panel, SVG or DXF).

**Watching it work.** It works in the Part's own panels and in sketch mode, as
you would: a panel opens, its values go in, the part rebuilds, and the tree and
the volume chip follow. In a sketch the curves appear where it guessed, then
each relation and dimension pulls them into shape until the sketch is Fully
defined. Its panels carry an **Assistant** badge and cannot be typed in (a tall
one still scrolls); their Done reads "The Assistant is filling this in · Esc
takes over (the Assistant pauses)", and its sketch says "The Assistant is
drawing this sketch · Esc takes over". With the Sketch panel collapsed to its
rail, the rail says **Assistant** too and its Finish sketch waits the same way.
- **Watch or Fast** (the chip): Watch, the default, pauses a moment at each
  step (at most 6 s per call); Fast makes each step at once. Your choice is
  kept. Watching needs the Magnusim window shown: in a hidden window, or a
  covered one (Windows reports a covered window as hidden), the steps run
  without pauses and the Assistant is told so. A part whose rebuild takes more
  than 1.5 s also runs without pauses.
- **The camera.** At the watch pace the view turns for its sketches and new
  extrudes as it does for yours (square to a new sketch, Isometric when a new
  extrude would be seen end on), until you move the camera yourself: from then
  on, for the rest of that request, it leaves your view alone. Its pictures are
  drawn off screen: they never move your camera, change your section view or
  change the Part.

**The chip.** While a request runs, the Assistant chip in the dock (bottom left)
says what it does:

| The chip says | Buttons |
|---|---|
| Assistant · thinking · 12 of 120 steps | Pause, Stop, Ask each step |
| Assistant · Sketch Plate sketch · 12 of 120 steps | Pause, Stop, Fast (or Watch), Ask each step |
| Assistant waits for you: close the Fillet 2 panel | Pause, Stop |
| Assistant: Extrude Boss · keep it? | Keep, Discard |
| Assistant paused · you took over | Resume, Stop |
| Assistant: <your request> · done | Undo |

A request on a coding agent counts its changes instead of its steps
("Assistant · thinking · 3 of 24 changes"): past its change limit its edits are
refused while it can still read the Part.

- **Pause**: its edits wait until you Resume; it can still read the Part. A
  step it is making when you pause stops where it is (at its next pace) and
  goes on at Resume; nothing of it is kept or saved until then. A pause ends
  with the request.
- **Stop** ends the request. The step it is on is not kept; its earlier steps
  stay, and Undo takes them back.
- **Ask each step** (off by default; your choice is kept): each edit waits
  after its rebuild for **Keep** or **Discard**. Discard puts the Part back as it
  was before that step, and the Assistant is told to ask you what to change. No
  answer within 10 minutes counts as Discard.
- **When the request ends** the chip says how ("done", "stopped", "failed",
  "stopped at its limits") for two minutes, or until the Part changes, with the
  Part's health: "· Fillet 1 fails", "· 1 sketch under-defined", "· 2 features
  with a warning" (red for a failure, amber for the others). A click on those
  words selects the first such feature in the tree. **Undo** shows while the
  request's changes are the newest step.

**You come first.**
- While you have a feature or tool panel open, a value typed and not applied, a
  rename, a menu or a dialog, or while the rollback bar is not at the end, its
  edits wait and the chip says for what ("close the Fillet 2 panel", "move the
  rollback bar to the end"). Its reads go on. After 10 minutes the Assistant is
  told you are busy, and to say what it needs and end its request. A Parameters
  panel you have open but are not typing in does not count: it stays open, shows
  the new values and flashes the rows that changed.
- **Taking over.** During one of its steps, Escape, Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Y (the Undo
  button's tip then says it takes the step over), a toolbar or tree command
  (Parameters too), or Enter or Finish sketch in its sketch takes the step
  over: it is discarded, nothing of it is kept, and the Assistant pauses in this
  Part until the request ends (the chip's Resume lets it go on). A change of
  yours to the Part during a step (a rename, a value, a Delete) stops it too,
  and yours is kept; what the step had already made before your change (the
  offset plane of its sketch, say) then stays as well, since taking it back
  would undo yours. The Assistant is told what stayed, the chip names it when
  it pauses ("you took over · Plane 1 stayed"), and Ctrl+Z takes it back.
  Undoing its steps while the request runs pauses it the same way ("you undid
  its steps"; a redo: "you redid its steps").
- **Looking is not taking over**: selecting, hovering and orbiting in the view,
  and clicks on the fields of its panel.
- It is told to leave what you made alone unless you ask, and everything it
  changes is an undo step of its own.

**Undo.** All of one request's changes are one undo step: the Undo button's tip
reads "Undo Assistant: <your request>" (its first line), and one Ctrl+Z, or the
chip's Undo, takes them all back; Ctrl+Y brings them back. A change of yours
during the request starts a new undo step, so it is never undone with the
Assistant's. The Assistant's own undo takes back only its own steps and stops at
any change of yours. Like every edit in CAD, undo lasts while the Part stays
open: Back or a reload clears it.

**Deleting asks you.** Before the Assistant deletes features the app asks
"Allow the Assistant to delete features?", "Deletes features from the Part;
one Ctrl+Z takes back the whole request, this deletion with it.", with the
keyboard on **Don't**. A feature another one
uses is not deleted; the Assistant is told which features use it.

**Honest results.** Each call applies completely or not at all (unless you
change the Part while it runs: see Taking over). While a call runs, the saved
Part stays as it was before it, so a reload, a crash or Back in the middle of
one never leaves half a step in the Part. A feature that fails (a
fillet too large, a join that touches nothing, a cut that misses the part) is
not kept, and its reason goes back to the model, with which way a cut missed. A
changed size that would break a later feature is put back. A change of
structure (a new sketch shape, a deleted feature) that breaks a later feature is
kept, and the broken feature is named. Every sketch goes through the solver; one
left under-defined is kept and shows in the chip's health at the end. The
Assistant is asked to measure the Part and look at it before it says it is
done.

**Limits and local models.**
- A watched build takes many calls: tens for a plate or a bracket, up to about
  100 for a part of two interlocking bodies. The app's limits per request
  (Settings > Assistant; by default 120 steps, $8 and 60 minutes) cover that,
  and the time it waits for you does not count against the minutes.
- A local model needs a context of at least 24,000 tokens for the Part's tools
  (below that, the tools answer that it needs a longer one); load it with
  48,000 or more: the tools and their notes alone take about 12,000 tokens. A
  local model that reads no images gets no pictures; it measures and reads the
  Part instead.

## Mouse and keys

The view moves the way the simulation viewer's does, in model and sketch mode:

| Input | Does |
|---|---|
| Left drag | Orbits, wherever it starts. In sketch mode, a drag that starts on sketch geometry moves it instead (what is under-defined). |
| Shift + left drag, middle drag | Pans |
| Wheel, right drag | Zooms (to the cursor) |
| Alt + left drag | Orbits, always (also while a sketch tool draws) |
| **Ctrl + drag** | **Box select**: left to right selects what the box encloses (solid box), right to left what it touches (dashed box); Ctrl+Shift + drag adds; an empty box clears. In model mode it takes what is visible: edges with no filter, else the filter's bodies, faces, edges or vertices. |
| Click, Ctrl+click | Select; Ctrl+click toggles one item (in a sketch it also adds a body vertex or edge, projected) |
| Right click | The context menu |

**Model mode:** E Extrude, Q Press-pull, M Move/copy body, F Fit, N Normal to, 1–7 the standard
views (Front, Back, Left, Right, Top, Bottom, Isometric), Delete (on faces:
Delete faces), Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Y, Escape clears the selection.

**Sketch mode:** L Line, R Rectangle, C Circle, A 3-point arc, S Spline,
M Mirror, O Offset, P Project, D Dimension, T Trim, X Construction, N Normal to
(the open sketch), Ctrl+C Copy and Ctrl+V Paste (the selected sketch geometry;
in a text or number field they are the field's), Enter places an open tool step or finishes the sketch
(on a menu item, or a button you reached with Tab, Enter presses that instead),
Escape steps back (a line chain first, then the tool), then clears the selection.
A tool's own key pressed again while it is in hand (L with Line, or the key you
gave it), or its toolbar button clicked again, puts the tool down at once, as
Escape pressed until the tool is gone; what you drew stays. Ctrl held while drawing turns
snapping off. `Ctrl+\` collapses or expands the Sketch panel (in model mode: the
design tree).

**Normal to** (N, the views menu, and the right-click menu of a face, a plane, a
sketch's row or its curves in the view) turns the view square to a flat face, a
plane or a sketch. A curved face is refused in words.

## Known limitations in 0.1.0

**Scope.** 0.1.0 makes multi-body parts. Assemblies and joints, surface
modeling, 2D drawings, sheet metal and feature recognition on imported parts are
not part of it. There is no draft of existing faces (Extrude's Draft angle
tapers what it extrudes), variable-radius fillet, guide rail for Loft or Sweep,
external (bolt) thread, or 3D sketch yet. A geometry that was added to a project
as a STEP file cannot be opened in CAD yet: start a Part and use Import STEP.

**Size.** The kernel runs in the browser with at most 4 GB of memory. A 113 MB
STEP file (about 12,000 faces) works but takes up to a minute to import; much
larger files may not fit. On a PC without graphics acceleration, a box selection
or Escape on such a part pauses for about a second.

**Press-pull** refuses, rather than leave a step, when a face next to the moved
face is not square to it and OCCT's offset cannot extend it. On imported parts
this includes many pipes and cones that meet spline faces. Faces tangent to a
moved face always move with it (the panel says how many); there is no switch to
keep them still. Only a simple fillet (one face between two faces) is re-rounded;
a chain of fillets or a corner blend is refused. Chamfers keep their size only
when a Chamfer feature made them. Some spline faces cannot be offset at all, and
the refusal says so. On parts over 2,000 faces the "what works" distance is not
searched ("A smaller distance may work").

**Sketches.**
- An offset of a spline is a new spline through offset points: it does not
  follow later changes of the source spline.
- Extend works on lines and arcs, not splines (a line or an arc can be extended
  to a spline).
- Dimensions take a spline's points, not the curve itself (no length or
  curvature dimension).
- Sketch Fillet works on two lines, or a line and an arc, that share a corner.
- Chamfer "Same distance" writes two dimensions with the same value; changing
  one does not change the other.
- A projected face, silhouette or intersection whose number of curves changes
  after an upstream edit keeps its old curves until you open the sketch ("changed:
  open Sketch N to update it").
- The centre snap needs the round edge hovered first. Spline edges of a body
  offer only their end points and pierce points as snaps.

**Patterns.** A pattern of faces copies the boss or pocket the faces bound; it
does not move the original faces. A copy far outside the view has no marker;
use the panel's Make it again row. Sketch features default to New body: a
Revolve or Sweep touching a body is not joined to it until you choose Join.

**Selection.** A box takes only what is visible. Planes are not boxed (click
them), and in Wireframe faces and bodies are not boxed.

**Other.**
- Sweep's Keep orientation does not move the profile to the start of the path.
- On very large imports, Fillet's "which radius works" search can run out of
  time; you then get the failure without a suggestion.
- The note that a broken, unused reference was left out of the update shows in
  the header while you leave, not in the landing report.
- Some blends OCCT 7.9.3 cannot build (for example a small tangential inlet
  blend on a cyclone part).

## Licence

GPL-3.0-or-later, like Magnusim (the repository's `LICENSE`). The third-party
parts the plugin ships (Open CASCADE, PlaneGCS, Eigen, Boost headers, the
Emscripten and LLVM runtimes, musl, three.js, three-mesh-bvh) and where their
sources are: `LICENSES/README.md`.

## Developer

### Host API

It needs Magnusim's host API 1.7: Edit in CAD (the manifest's `[[geometry_actions]]`;
`ws.context.geometry` and `launch`, `ws.project.geometrySource` and `geometryFaces`,
and `linkGeometry`'s `originalNames`, 1.7: `src/link/edit-open.ts` and `adopt.ts`);
a Part's design becomes a geometry of its
project (`ws.project.linkGeometry`, the Part study kind's `links_geometry`, 1.5),
and its panels are drawn with the host's UI kit (`@magnusim/plugin-ui`, 1.3).
The sync runs when the user leaves the Part (the host's exit hook,
`ws.nav.onLeave`, 1.6). From 1.2 it uses `ws.files` to save a Part's model (etag-checked
writes, so two tabs never overwrite each other) and asks before leaving the
workspace while a change is not saved yet. (The document still falls back to
`ws.data` on a 1.1 host; the unit tests' fake host uses that path.) The toolbar
layout uses the host's per-user plugin prefs (`ws.prefs`) when the host has them,
else it is kept per project.

The Assistant's tools (in development) use `ws.assistant` from the app's host API
1.9, which is not released yet: the host still reports 1.8, and the manifest
stays at 1.7. `assistantOf` in `src/lib/bridge.ts` finds it in the SDK the host
served, and so do the newer parts the tools use when they are there (an error's
hint and detail, a result's summary, the turn events and Stop, a call that waits
for the person, the delete's confirm note). On a host without `ws.assistant` the
Part offers no tools and works as before.

There is no Python backend (`plugin.py` registers nothing; `manifest.toml`
declares the workspace, the study kind and the start actions). The description
in `manifest.toml` (shown in Settings > Plugins) names only what ships: it is updated
in Magnusim as features land.

### Layout

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `manifest.toml`, `plugin.py` | What the host reads. `plugin.py` is the only Python file in the plugin. |
| `src/` | TypeScript source of the workspace page and its workers. `src/assistant/` holds the Part's tools for the app's Assistant. |
| `workspace/` | **Built output only** (what the host serves to the frame): `index.html`, `app.js`, `app.css`, `kernel/` (kernel worker + `mk32.mjs/.wasm`), `solver/` (`planegcs.mjs/.wasm`), `pick/` (the picking worker). Never edit by hand. |
| `kernel-build/` | OCCT + facade build (pinned sources, patches, scripts), and the vendored Analysis Situs files it links (`kernel-build/asi/`). See `kernel-build/SOURCES.md`. |
| `solver-build/` | PlaneGCS build (pinned upstream, our patch, script). See `solver-build/SOURCES.md`. |
| `LICENSES/` | Third-party licence texts and the LGPL source and relinking notes. |
| `scripts/` | `build.mjs` (page + workers) and what it runs (`keymap-load.mjs`, `make-banana.mjs`, `lock.mjs`). |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | What changed in each version, for users. |

### Build and test

The plugin has its own toolchain and packages; the app's typecheck never sees
its `src/`.

```
cd bundled-plugins/cad
npm ci                 # own node_modules (gitignored)
npm run build          # src/ -> workspace/ (page + worker modules)
npm run build:check    # workspace/ must be exactly the build of src/
```

`npm run typecheck:cad` in `magnusim-web` checks the plugin's TypeScript. The
kernel and solver binaries are rebuilt only when their sources change, on Linux
or WSL: `kernel-build/build.sh`, `solver-build/build.sh`.

The plugin's tests and its other developer scripts for this version are in Magnusim's development version, in its `magnusim-web/bundled-plugins/cad` folder (<https://github.com/Lilmill2000/Magnusim>).

### Separation rules

- The core never imports the plugin, and the plugin never imports core code:
  the page talks to the app only through `@magnusim/workspace` (the bridge),
  wrapped in `src/lib/bridge.ts`.
- `plugin.py` is the only `.py` file (Magnusim's `python/tools/plugin_boundary.py` checks
  every `.py` in the plugin; `node_modules/` holds none today).
- React, React DOM, the bridge and the UI kit (`@magnusim/plugin-ui`) come
  from the host's import map; they are never bundled. Workers get no import map: worker modules are self-contained.
- The frame has no localStorage, IndexedDB or cookies, no `/api/`, no popups
  and no `alert`/`confirm`. Saved state goes through the bridge.
- No change in the core is needed to build or run the plugin. The host
  features it uses (plugin files with etags, unsaved-work questions, frame
  focus, off-by-default plugins, the UI kit, linked geometries, the exit hook,
  start actions, plugin prefs, a workspace's tools for the Assistant) are
  generic host APIs.
- The Assistant's tools reach the app only through `ws.assistant`. No test
  calls a real model provider (the specs use the app's scripted model), and no
  file of the plugin names a model vendor or is a coding tool's file: Magnusim's
  `scripts/__tests__/vendor-names.test.mjs` reads every tracked file here.
- Dependencies must be GPL-3.0-compatible; code from AGPL projects or
  jsketcher is never copied.
